# 🚗 Persistent Car Damage Insurance Portal

A web-based car insurance claim system developed during my internship at Persistent Systems.  
Users can submit accident details, upload images or videos, and predict damage severity using ML.  
The platform auto-generates cost estimates and reports for faster, more accurate claim processing.
